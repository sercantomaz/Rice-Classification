# Purpose of the Project
## This repository contains the implementation of rice classification using various machine learning algorithms in R programming language.
The following machine learning models were utilized for the classification task:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Classification Tree
* AdaBoosting
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* XGBoost
* Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
